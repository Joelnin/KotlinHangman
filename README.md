# Overview

This project is a simple **Hangman game** written in **Kotlin**.  
The purpose of this program is to strengthen my understanding of the Kotlin language. I focused on understanding the core programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, collections, functions, and classes.

This Hangman game allows a player to choose a theme (Animals, Nature, Objects, or Random) and then try to guess a randomly selected secret word, this is done letter by letter. The player has a limited number of attempts (in the meantime just 6) and a final opportunity to guess the entire word before losing the game.

My main goal was to learn a new coding language as Kotlin and practice its syntax and features in a fun, interactive project. This project helped me learn how to work with **mutable** and **immutable variables**, manipulate **collections**, use **expressions** and **conditionals**, and build a game **loop**.

# Development Environment

**IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (JetBrains)
**Programming Language:** Kotlin
**Libraries:** Standard Kotlin libraries

# Future Work

- Add art for the hangman so the game is more visual.
- Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with different numbers of max attempts or letters for the secret word options.
- Store the player statistics (games won, games lost, which levels have been played and how many times).
- Improve input validation (such as ignoring numbers and symbols while guessing).
